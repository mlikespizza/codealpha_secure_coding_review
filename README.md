# Secure Coding Review with Node.js

## Project Overview
In this task, I performed a secure coding review on a Node.js application to identify and document potential security vulnerabilities. Using static code analysis tools, I evaluated the code for common security flaws and suggested improvements to enhance security.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Tools**: NodeJsScan, ESLint

## Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run NodeJsScan for static code analysis:
   ```bash
   nodejsscan -d /path/to/your/project
   ```

## Key Features
- **Static Code Analysis**: Detects common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, insecure dependencies, and unsafe code patterns.
- **Code Review Findings**: Documented security issues with recommendations on remediation.
- **Secure Development Practices**: Emphasis on secure coding principles, such as input validation and error handling.

## Usage & Examples
To perform a scan on the Node.js codebase:
```bash
nodejsscan -d /path/to/project
```

Example output:
```
[High] SQL Injection vulnerability found in db.js at line 12
```

## Learnings & Challenges
This task helped me understand the importance of proactive code reviews for identifying vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. The main challenge was adapting NodeJsScan's output into actionable recommendations.
